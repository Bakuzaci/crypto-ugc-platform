## Why Crypto Projects Choose CryptoNoise

Traditional influencer marketing is broken for Web3. Upfront fees with no accountability. Fake followers. Zero conversion tracking. You deserve better.

**CryptoNoise flips the model:** Creators earn when you grow. Our performance-based marketplace means:

- **No upfront creator fees** - Pay only when content delivers views and conversions
- **Verified Web3 creators** - Every creator understands crypto and has proven engagement
- **Transparent attribution** - Know exactly which video drove each wallet connection
- **Automated everything** - From creator matching to content approval to payouts
